        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
          In Clash of Clans, players build and manage their own villages and
          armies. They must train troops, collect resources, and defend their
          villages from enemy attacks. Players can join clans and participate in
          clan wars, which allows them to compete against other clans and win
          valuable rewards.

          training troops and defending against enemy attacks. The game is easy
